Description : >-
  A charismatic orator and a pillar of orthodoxy. Justice Castinus is best known as the
  public face of the Tribunal, the senior member in a Triumvirate of supposed equals. His
  ironfast determination to safeguard the Commonwealth's spiritual purity is equal parts
  inspiring and and terrifying. He makes no secret of his distaste for change, though
  he will uphold all of the Tribunal's decisions with the same ferocity, even if it
  goes against his personal beliefs.

  Call to the Trials : |-
    Wretched exiles, rejoice! The path to redemption lies before you. With the blessing of the
    Syndic before Us, it is time again to welcome The Worthy back into Our loving embrace, absolved
    of all prior misdeeds.
    
    Be warned! The road ahead is perilous, and success is fleeting. Your avarice and pride led to your exile,
    do not make the same mistake again. As the Commonwealth stands united so must you!
    Seek out your fellow wretches, none who are alone may compete. Demonstrate that you have put your 
    past transgressions aside, assist one another as you repay your debts to the communities you've wronged,
    and surely you shall earn your freedom.
    
    To those who would seek to undermine the Rites through underhanded means, a warning: Though you may
    be opponents in the Trials, Life-blood, itself, is never to be shed, before, during, or after any Rite, 
    lest the disobeyer suffer permanent expulsion from this mortal coil. Exile is injury enough; 
    the Rites are an act of mercy.
    
    Go forth, and become free! Then, join with others such as you, and lead, with mercy, 
    continuing to demonstrate your worth. May the stars shine ever brightly on us all.
