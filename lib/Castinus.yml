Description : >-
  A charismatic orator and a pillar of orthodoxy. Justice Castinus is best known as the
  public face of the Tribunal, the senior member in a Triumvirate of supposed equals. His
  ironfast determination to safeguard the Commonwealth's spiritual purity is equal parts
  inspiring and and terrifying. He makes no secret of his distaste for change, though
  he will uphold all of the Tribunal's decisions with the same ferocity, even if it
  goes against his personal beliefs.
