  Description: >-
    Magical symbols used to mark an exile or a convict. These marks denote the bearer has
    been found guilty of a transgression against society by a tribunal, and is exiled
    from all but the most remote of villages.
    
    
    The marks assert themselves no matter what covering or concealment is attempted,
    and can only be removed by extremely powerful magic, typically only through
    Absolution of their transgressions through the Trials.
