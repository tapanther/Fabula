    Arothization : >-
      Due to Aroth's historical dominance over Lanaroth, it is common to see transliterations (letter-mapping)
      or transcriptions (sound-mapping) of text from various nations and languages to their Arothian equivalents.
      
      
      Notable conventions have emerged, such as the voiceless velar plosive `[k]` written as `c` (e.g., Iska -> Isca),
      while the voiceless alveolar fricative `[s]` is often converted to `s` (e.g., Taureucia -> Toresia) to 
      disambiguate the two.
      
      
      Owing to the difficulties encountered in transliterating and transcribing both ancient and modern texts
      to standard Arothian graphemes, a number of proposed schemes have been put forth by scholars throughout
      Lanaroth, the most common of which is reproduced in the page for Arothization Tables.
  Description : >-
    The Basileia of Aroth is the single most influential nation-state in the history of the continent, whose name
    literally means "The Lands of Aroth". The Basileia's borders once spanned some estimated 5 million square
    kilometers across three continents, ruling over some 60 million people at it's height.
    
    
    Elements of Arothian culture can be found across the nations of Lanaroth, from borrowed words and spellings
    to full on adoption of the Arothian identity as a point of national pride, with several partitioned kingdoms
    throughout history claiming the title of the true successor state to the Basileia.
    
    
    The modern-day Basileia of Aroth, which encompasses the region surrounding the City of Aroth proper and the
    Vinovian countryside, is considered by many a separate entity from the empire that ruled the continent, as
    the political and social centers of the empire had moved several times before the widely agreed-upon end of
    the empire in 1425. The ancient city still remains to many the symbol of the dead empire with which it shares
    a name.

    Aroth is a constitutional monarchy, where the Basielus serves as both head of state as well as the
    primarch of the Arothian faith. The Curia is a 347-member unicameral legislature which officially
    _advises_ the Basielus and runs the common operation of the nation in their name. The Basielus may,
    in a time of national crisis, be empowered by the Curia to act as an autocrat for a period of time
    determined by the assembly.
  Locations:
    City of Aroth : >-
      The eponymous city from antiquity. The City of Aroth has seen drastic periods of expansion, collapse,
      rebuilding, invasion, sacking, and reconstruction, all of which have contributed to the drastic
      anachronistic appearance, with millenia-old structures standing next to recent constructions in a
      veritable labyrinth of alleyways, cobbled streets, paved avenues, walls, gates, bridges and tunnels.
  Organizations:
    Basielus of Aroth : >-
      Monarch of the Kingdom. The current Basielus, Servius Veturius, ascended to the throne upon his
      father's untimely death shortly after achieving majority.

Culture :
  Description : >-
    Aroth is a highly militaristic and religious nation, with the Basielus acting as both head of state and 
    head of the faith. Military service is a requirement for full citizenship, and Aroth boasts the largest
    official military _and_ clergy per capita in Lanaroth, as all members of the armed forces are considered
    members of the clergy, owing to Aroth's unique warrior-priest heritage. State functions are an equal mix of
    religious service and military pageantry.
    
    
    While Aroth is not a true theocracy, as the Curia and Basielus do not claim divine right, the Arothian
    faith is inexorably intertwined with every aspect of the culture. The Arothian state employs thousands
    of official Augurs, interpreters of omens and divine intent that advise and assist civic officials in
    all aspects of governance and policy.
