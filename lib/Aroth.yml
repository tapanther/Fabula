    Arothization : >-
      Due to Aroth's historical dominance over Lanaroth, it is common to see transliterations (letter-mapping)
      or transcriptions (sound-mapping) of text from various nations and languages to their Arothian equivalents.
      
      
      Notable conventions have emerged, such as the voiceless velar plosive `[k]` written as `c` (e.g., Iska -> Isca),
      while the voiceless alveolar fricative `[s]` is often converted to `s` (e.g., Taureucia -> Toresia) to 
      disambiguate the two.
      
      
      Owing to the difficulties encountered in transliterating and transcribing both ancient and modern texts
      to standard Arothian graphemes, a number of proposed schemes have been put forth by scholars throughout
      Lanaroth, the most common of which is reproduced in the page for Arothization Tables.
