Description : |-
  The older of two twin Goga's, sole inheritor of the family wealth, posessions, and titles. He is rather graceful
  by comparison to his twin, gliding through society and insinuating himself into beneficial positions.
  
  He has a notable disdain for his twin brother Tzatziki, whom he sees as a useless layabout more interested in
  wine and parties than the furtherance of the family's prestige and power.

    One of the brigands attacking Mihaela Nicolae, the herbalist and black market tinctures trader, let slip
    that "Goga" is not paying them enough to risk their lives. The bandit leader further implicated "Goga" may
    have authority or control over the City Guard. A note of extremely fine quality was found with a map to
    Mihaela, with instruction to dispose of her after burning "the books".
