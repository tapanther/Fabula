    Superficially, the Commonwealth resembles the constitutional monarchies of its neighbors. 
    A strong central authority directly rules over the nation, with its power both derived
    from and limited by an uncodified constitution that is equal parts law and tradition.
    Local governments serve at the pleasure and direction of the central government, managing
    the day-to-day affairs of towns and cities in accordance with national edicts and laws.
    
    
    Unlike the traditional monarchies that surround it, power is not vested in a single head
    of state or elected assembly, but rather in a three-person college known as the Supreme
    Judicial Tribunal, tasked with preserving the Commonwealth's cultural orthodoxy and
    entrusted with the sole authority to interpret the doctrinal intent of the nation's
    unwritten constitution.
  Locations:
    Velia : >-
      Capital of the Commonwealth, the city of Velia lies at the mouth of the Borealan.
      Velia was the former administrative capital of Aroth, and has served as the permanent seat of
      the Iskan Kingdom and the succeeding Commonwealth. Thanks to its strategic positioning
      along the major Lanaranth trade routes, effectively controls trade between the Vedaelan and 
      Meldryn seas.
  Organizations:
    Supreme Judicial Tribunal : >-
      The effective ruling triumvirate of the Commonwealth. The Tribunal convenes within the
      Great Hall of the Basilica of the Curia at the center of the city when hearing issues and
      delivering doctrinal rulings.
    Stratia : >-
      The general term for all categories of state and local officials under the jurisdiction
      of the Commonwealth and the Tribunal.
    Syndic of the Boreal: >-
      The _de facto_ state religion of the Commonwealth, a polytheistic and animistic belief
      system lacking an official central authority. The Syndic revolves around supernatural
      entities that embody all things, including forces of nature and prominent landscape
      locations. Public shrines can be found throughout the Commonwealth and maintained by
      volunteers from the local populace.

Culture :
  Description : >-
    <TBD - I would like you all to contribute some aspect of Commonwealth culture. What does it look
    like? How do people view themselves here?>
    
    
    Commonwealth culture is highly stratified, both by geography and by bloodline. 
    
    The old Iskaran aristocracy, those with verifiable lineage dating to the Arothian or Iskaran nobility for 
    at least ten generations, largely enjoy greater social standing and opportunity as they are seen as the
    custodians of Iskaran heritage and expected to act in accordance with their station. Known as Linea
    (or Full Linea), the aristocracy holds the majority of Assembly positions and major merchant,
    artisanal, and commercial ventures.
    
    
    Iskaran-descendants without noble lineage or those of unconfirmed or dubious noble lineage, known as Par-Linea or
    Half Linea, compose the majority of the population in major cities, particularly Velia, and are generally
    afforded better education and opportunities, often with state and private subsidies. They form the majority
    of the professional, artisanal, and mercantile class, and hold a minority of positions in the Assemblies.
    
    
    Non-Iskarans, particularly those of foreign heritage or residing in the small towns and villages in 
    the Iskaran countryside, are typically relegated to positions of manual or menial labor. They are significantly
    underrepresented in the Assemblies compared to their proportional population despite repeated efforts to
    nominate more Non-Linea delegates, particularly in the outlying regions.
    
    
    Where the Kingdom of Iska fullheartedly embraced the notion that it was the true continuator state
    for the Empire of Aroth, the Commonwealth is largely a rejection of Arothian heritage and a return
    to what is considered traditional Iskaran identity. To this end, the Supreme Judicial Tribunal serves 
    to preserve and promote Iskaran values through binding opinions and decisions that set the direction for 
    the national and local assemblies, and permeate through to every aspect of the Commonwealth.

    The Trials of Absolution : >-
      A semiannuial competition through which eligible outcasts may earn an official pardon
      for their acts and return home, absolved of all prior transgressions. Only the top
      three scoring teams are granted amnesty.
  Religion : >-
    From time immemorial, people have been awed by the blazing chromatic inferno that
    overtakes the night sky a few times each year. The event was believed to be a massive
    congress of spirits, coming together from all parts of the world to cross the veil.
    
    
    While the exact date of the event itself was unpredictable, its appearance seemed to be
    tied to the changing seasons, leading many early peoples to embark on a pilgrimage to
    the peninsula around the Solstices and Equinoctes in the hopes of witnessing the
    spiritual congress, which came to be known as the Syndic of the Boreal, from the old
    Iskaran words for the Northern Congregation.
    
    
    The awe inspiring sight, waves and tendrils of scintillating colors weaving around
    one another, did much to cement the belief in a multitude of natural spirits. Thousands
    of shrines dot the landscape, from simple stone cairns to full manned temples, some
    older than the settlements that surround them, uncountably many more that have been lost
    to the natural decay that comes with time. Still hundreds more are added with every passing
    year, small dedications, often by lone individuals, to mark gratitude or a significant personal
    event that was aided by a sympathetic supernatural.
    
    
    Without a well defined priesthood, beliefs and practices tend to vary greatly throughout Iska.
    Superstition tends towards the invisible hand of the spiritual world seeking balance.
    A rainstorm to keep the land from turning to desert, a fire to clear out brush and make way 
    for new growth, not always in the best interests of people living in the land, but necessary
    nonetheless. Still, every spirit is unique and embodied with agency and free will, from the
    solemn, slumbering mountains to the tiny tricksters that fill the attics of homes with
    acorns, all existing just beyond the visible world but omnipresent.
History :
  Description : >-
    The Commonwealth of Iska is the successor state to the Kingdom of Iska, established
    after the decade of civil unrest that followed the death of Queen Iustina the Unjust
    and the series of pretenders unsuccessfully warring for legitimacy.


    The Commonwealth was formally declared in 2151 by Canus Cassius, a former nobleman
    who had been exiled in 2147 after being implicated in an assassiation attempt against
    the then pretender to the crown, Pyrrha Duca. Canus and a sizeable majority of the
    Red Cloaks would enter Velia to depose Florian Gregoras, last pretender to the Iskaran
    Crown, after the latter imprisoned Canus' sister and younger brothers on fabricated
    charges of conspiracy and treason.
    
    
    Canus famously threw the Iskaran Crown into the Basilica pyre, declaring:
    
    
    !!! quote
        The old empires ruled according to ancient bloodlines thought to be infallible.
        No more. Only the worthy shall lead...
    
    
    Canus would charge the surviving Censors of the Curia with the task of reconciling
    centuries of legal and cultural tradition to create the legal basis for the new
    Commonwealth. This process would take a further tweleve years, resulting in the
    creation of the Tribunal and the adoption of the collected documents and opinions
    as the Commonwealth's Constitution.
