    Superficially, the Commonwealth resembles the constitutional monarchies of its neighbors. 
    A strong central authority directly rules over the nation, with its power both derived
    from and limited by an uncodified constitution that is equal parts law and tradition.
    Local governments serve at the pleasure and direction of the central government, managing
    the day-to-day affairs of towns and cities in accordance with national edicts and laws.
    
    Unlike the traditional monarchies that surround it, power is not vested in a single head
    of state or elected assembly, but rather in a three-person college known as the Supreme
    Judicial Tribunal, tasked with preserving the Commonwealth's cultural orthodoxy and
    entrusted with the sole authority to interpret the doctrinal intent of the nation's
    unwritten constitution.
