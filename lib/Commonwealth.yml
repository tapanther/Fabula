    Superficially, the Commonwealth resembles the constitutional monarchies of its neighbors. 
    A strong central authority directly rules over the nation, with its power both derived
    from and limited by an uncodified constitution that is equal parts law and tradition.
    Local governments serve at the pleasure and direction of the central government, managing
    the day-to-day affairs of towns and cities in accordance with national edicts and laws.
    
    Unlike the traditional monarchies that surround it, power is not vested in a single head
    of state or elected assembly, but rather in a three-person college known as the Supreme
    Judicial Tribunal, tasked with preserving the Commonwealth's cultural orthodoxy and
    entrusted with the sole authority to interpret the doctrinal intent of the nation's
    unwritten constitution.
  Locations:
    Velia : >-
      Capital of the Commonwealth, the city of Velia lies at the mouth of the Borealan.
      Velia was the former administrative capital of Aroth, and has served as the permanent seat of
      the Iskan Kingdom and the succeeding Commonwealth. Thanks to its strategic positioning
      along the major Lanaranth trade routes, effectively controls trade between the Vedaelan and 
      Meldryn seas.
  Organizations:
    Supreme Judicial Tribunal : >-
      The effective ruling triumvirate of the Commonwealth. The Tribunal convenes within the
      Great Hall of the Basilica of the Curia at the center of the city when hearing issues and
      delivering doctrinal rulings.
    Stratia : >-
      The general term for all categories of state and local officials under the jurisdiction
      of the Commonwealth and the Tribunal.
    Syndic of the Boreal: >-
      The _de facto_ state religion of the Commonwealth, a polytheistic and animistic belief
      system lacking an official central authority. The Syndic revolves around supernatural
      entities that embody all things, including forces of nature and prominent landscape
      locations. Public shrines can be found throughout the Commonwealth and maintained by
      volunteers from the local populace.
