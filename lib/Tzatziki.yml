  The younger of two Goga twins, passed over for the wealth and titles for being born a few minutes too late. He
  is the brasher of the two, more prone to direct outbursts and tantrums. He is always looking for a way to supplant
  his brother and demonstrate that the family fortunes and prestige should belong to him, but has had limited success
  on that front.
