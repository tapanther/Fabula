GeneralInfo :
  Statistics :
    Type : City
    Region : Lanaroth
    Population : 21298
  Description : |-
    The first major population center along the Exocos Odo, the primary road connecting the City of Aroth
    to Velia. Besides the strong mercantile presence and its importance as a primary trade hub, the city is
    notable for being one of the official registration centers for exiles wishing to participate in the Trials
    of Absolution.
    
    Despite it's relatively small size, owing mostly due to the lack of available space due to geographical 
    restrictions, Cythamahos has served as the seat of government and administration throughout the Arothian
    and Iskan eras, hosting both the Curia Minor and the Local Assembly that replaced it, as well as being
    the former seat of an Augur's diokesis.
Geography :
  Description : |-
    The city is built at the cliff-side base of a strike ridge that diverts the Exocos. Natural hot springs
    well up along the cliffisde, which attracted early settlers and traders weary from the journey between the
    new and old capital of the Basileia. Other nearby hot springs give the administrative district its name, 
    Thermespontos.
    
    To the south lies a mixed forest, nourished by the constant rainfall as humid air is forced upwards by the
    gentle slope of the ridge opposite Cythamahos, cooling it and causing the water to precipitate out.
  Features:
    Aoroleios Ridge : >-
      Dotted with natural hot springs, the cliff-side face of the ridge is said to _weep_ as thermal springs
      seep out of the rock face. A number of bathhouses have been constructed along the cliffside, some going
      as far as to offer artificially constructed pools high up on the cliff face to overlook the city.
    Atarax Forest : >-
      A mixed forest with dense underbrush to the south of the Aoroleios Ridge. The forest receives an inordinate
      amount of precipitation thanks to the orographic lift provided by the ridgeline. It sits in contrast to the
      otherwise sparse forestation along the Aroth-Iska border.
    Cythamahos Diokesis : >-
      The ancient forum that hosted the Arothian Augur and the Curia Minor for the old administrative district. The
      forum now hosts the local Assembly and the various merchant guildhouse chapters.
    Cythamahos Amphitheatre : >-
      An open-air amphitheatre used by the local Assembly for various events and functions, ranging from
      monthly games and races to the various stages of the Trials of Absolution.
