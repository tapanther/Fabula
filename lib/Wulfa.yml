Description : >-
  A member of the Augur's Guard, currently assigned to Aurica. He was involved in a scandal involving Gratian's
  adventures in Pyrgeria ("to the North"), where the young Augur was grievously injured by the Beast he was tracking,
  apparently attempting to claim some of it's claws. Wulfa was later re-assigned to Aurica.

    Mil was part of the four-man guard carrying Gratian's palanquin. He should have been in Aurica's guard at the time,
    and it remains unclear how he was able to accompany Gratian.
