Description : >-
  Augur of Vindonissa, a region renown for their fine wines and liqueurs. He is often hunched over from age,
  but appears to be in his full faculties. He is known to associate with the Goga brothers, Tsitsishvili and Tzatziki,
  considering both more petty windbags than actual threats.
NotableEvents :
  Lady Duca's Party : >-
    He was extremely interested in Gratian's activities, expressing strong disapproval at the recklessness
    of youth, especially over such trifles as pretty feathers and shiny claws. He seems genuinely scared of
    Gratian's untimely death in the midst of some harebrained scheme for pretties.
