  Description : >-
    A small village on the Iskaran-Arothian border, 3 kilometers removed from the
    Exocos Odo, the primary roadway connecting Aroth and Velia. The town is primarily
    agrarian, taking advantage of the warmer climate closer to Aroth.
    
    
    The town center hosts a single main crossroads, primarily small shops serving the
    communities needs, and a single inn that typically hosts the passing traders that
    fill any supply gaps the village cannot manage on its own.
Geography :
  Description : >-
    Rolling green hills lie near a rocky outcropping, the village's proximity to the Berescaster Sea
    gives it a temperate climate that is well suited to agriculture. The region is occasionally plagued 
    by electrical storms that seem to strike out of nowhere, typically lasting a few hours before
    dissipating.
  Features:
    Kamynthos Shrine : >-
      A small roofed shrine nestled in a rocky outcropping on the connecting road to the Exocos.
      The altar depicts a multi-colored, two-tailed bird known locally as the Aeldra. Local legend 
      holds that the rainbow at the end of a tempest is made up of the bird's molted feathers.
