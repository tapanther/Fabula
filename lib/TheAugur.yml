  Surprisingly young for the silver diadem, his fur bears the old scars of a presumably violent youth.

  stylized eye Bearer Marks of an Augur.

  Prophesy to Minos : |-
    !!! quote 
        Child of calamity, Ruinbringer. Cut off from the life you were promised, forced to wander the
        wretches of the Outlands. You who seeks the sweet taste of acclaim and adoration will instead
        be forced to swallow the bitter brew of infamy before your name is forever stricken from the record.
        
        And yet, your fate is of your own choosing. You may embrace the foretold ruin that has been
        your undoing, fulfill the ill omen that hangs over your horns like the executioner's blade; or
        you may choose to rage against the stars that cursed your birth, shake off the yoke of prophesy
        around your shoulders, and forge your own destiny.
  Prophesy to Renata : |-
    !!! quote
        I see a path that leads to Velia, where your family resides, a road less taken beyond the Trials.
        Few who wander the Outlands earn the privilege of Absolution, fewer still are prepared to pay
        the price.
    
        Seek the guidace of the Augurs that roam the countryside, they may guide you past the Tribunal's
        eyes.
  To Antirrh : |-
    !!! quote
        What you seek is history, not prophesy. In the far north, well past Velia, in the frozen wastes,
        legend tells of a village named Nysanthus, burnt to ash when the spirit of the Moon and Stars
        fell from the heavens and scorched everything in it's path. There, within the grave of the
        heavens, you may find that which you seek.
