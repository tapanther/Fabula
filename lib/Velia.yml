    Nestled at the mouth of the Borealan, Velia was formally founded in 1267 by
    Gallienus Glycas, Basielus of Aroth, on the site of the already-existing
    city of Iskara (Az: _Iscara_).
    
    
    The city became famous for its architectural masterpieces, such as the Basilica of
    the Curia, the Gallean Tower, the Column of Halendos, the Vedealan Forum, the Temple
    to Hyelontos Ascendant, the Photius Lighthouse, and the Great Silver Gate of the Borea 
    among countless Linea palaces and manors that form the city proper.
    
    
    Following the collapse of Aroth, Velia remained the capital of the newly partitioned 
    Kingdom of Iska (1413 - 2141) and the Commonwealth of Iska (2151 - Present). The city
    today is the largest city in Lanaroth as well as its largest port and trade hub.
Geography :
  Description : >-
    Straddling the Borealan Strait, Velia is well positioned to control the flow of goods to and
    from the Vedaelan and Meldryn seas, effectively giving it a stranglehold on continental
    trade. The reduced land area and hilly surroundings provide excellent natural
    defenses, while also shielding the coastline from excessive winds and waves, making the
    location a safe anchorage and a natural position for a major port.
  Features:
    Basilica of the Curia : >-
      The major cultural and historic site of Velia, seat of the Supreme Judicial Tribunal.
      The Basilica is believed to be the largest interior space in the known world, and the
      epitome of Iskaran architecture.
