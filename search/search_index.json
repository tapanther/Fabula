As a pantheistic religion, the Arothian Faith does not have a central, personified deity, but rather considers the universe itself an immanent deity that directs its own propagation and creation. Personified or natural deities in other cultures and traditions are seen as manifestations or interpretations  of the universal divine, and thus not in conflict with the Arothian tradition. This has often led to the syncretism, or incorporation, of local tradition into the Arothian Faith.</p> <p>Collectively referred to as the Ephonian Mysteries, the central tenets of the Arothian Faith hold that the universe is a divine symphony, a literal harmony reverberating throughout the immaterium, or the empty void, from which all creation arises. These emergent entities, whether a living being or otherwise inert object, in turn resonate with and affect the universal harmony, and thus spring forth new emergent entities, creating a self-perpetuating, causal, and logical chain of existence. </p> <p>As the universal harmony is composed of everything that has ever been, and governs everything that will ever be, it is possible to deduce and predict the course of the universal symphony by observing the echoes and reverberations as they express themselves in the natural world. An impending unfavorable dissonance in the universal harmony, such as a great catastrophe or natural disaster, will create its own dissonant resonance in every day phenomena, such as the patterns of flying birds, the cracks in heated bones, the movements of the heavens, or even the sequence of drawn cards or rolled dice. Similarly, future positive consonance, such as that arising from a joyous or fortuitous event, will create its own distinct pattern that can be interpreted from ordinary events. The closer the observer is to the site or location of the event, the stronger these  resonances will be, and therefore the clearer the observable phenomena.</p> <p>As a result, augury and divination play a central role in the Arothian Faith. Those who can divine the universal resonances are held in the highest esteem, and are most often employed as official state  Augurs tasked with ensuring the success and prosperity of the Arothian people and state. Chief among these Augurs is the Basielus, who acts as the head of state and directs the nation as a whole.</p>"},{"location":"Aroth/#history","title":"History","text":""},{"location":"Aroth/#timeline","title":"Timeline","text":"Date Name Event 1425.01 Sack of Halendos The last capital city of Aroth, Halendos, is sacked and burned to the ground by the Vosjot army.
